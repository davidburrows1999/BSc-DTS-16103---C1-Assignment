# BSc-DTS-16103---C1-Assignment

This code is the source code for my C1 Software Fundamentals project.

**What the code does?** 
The code is designed to achieve a number of aims:
1. The code opens a CSV file abortion_rates.csv and parse the data
2. The code then performs a number of data analytics tasks on the code such as getting totals, performing calculations and creating new coloumns. This is being done using the Pandas libary.
3. The Matplotlib libary is used to plot the data.
4. The Matplotlib libary is used to plot the data against another data set that has been parsed as well (Total_Deaths_England_and_Wales.csv)
5. The output is plots of the data. 

**How to use the code?:** 
The code should be run in an appropriate Intergrated Developement Environment (IDE). The neccessary files should be downloaded from this Repo and stored in the same directory.

**Future Imporvements/ Features:**
I think adding in other data sets about specific causes of death such as road accidents or cancer and comparing them with Matplotlib. I think a more experienced programmer could have utilised more of the Matplotlib libary and created more visually appealing plots with different types of graphs. I think in future the statistics could have been ingested from the Goverment site automatically as they release them every year and this could make the process a lot more automated. 

**Libaries/Resources Used:**
Libaries used - Matplotlib, Python, Numpy
Websites used - Github, GeeksforGeeks,Stackoverflow
